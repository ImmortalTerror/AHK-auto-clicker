# Auto Clicker

Hold down left click or right click to use and F3 to pause the script. My first ahk script :) It has been updated now.

Note: If your using this in Minecraft I recommend changing the pause button to something like "r". To do this, on line 4 change "F3" to your button of choice.

E.g.
Default:
`*F3:: Suspend, Toggle`
Bound to "r" instead of F3:
`*r:: Suspend, Toggle`
